## A Memory-Driven Mapping Algorithm for Heterogeneous Systems

**mpibind** is a memory-driven algorithm to map parallel hybrid
applications to the underlying hardware resources transparently,
efficiently, and portably. Unlike other mappings, its primary design point
is the memory system, including the cache hierarchy. Compute elements
are selected based on a memory mapping and not vice versa. In
addition, *mpibind* embodies a global awareness of hybrid programming
abstractions as well as heterogeneous devices such as accelerators.

### Getting Started

This project uses GNU Autotools.

```
$ ./bootstrap

$ ./configure --prefix=<install_dir>

$ make

$ make install
```

The resulting library is `libmpibind` and a simple program using it is `src/main.c`


### Contributing

Contributions for bug fixes and new features are welcome and follow
the GitHub
[fork and pull model](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-collaborative-development-models).
Contributors develop on a branch of their personal fork and create
pull requests to merge their changes into the main repository. 

The steps are similar to those of the Flux framework:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) `mpibind`.
2. [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#keep-your-fork-synced)
your fork: `git clone git@github.com:[username]/mpibind.git`
3. Create a topic branch for your changes: `git checkout -b new_feature`
4. Create feature or add fix (and add tests if possible)
5. Make sure everything still passes: `make check`
6. Push the branch to your GitHub repo: `git push origin new_feature`
7. Create a pull request against `mpibind` and describe what your
changes do and why you think it should be merged. List any
outstanding *todo* items.
